## Installation

```bash
npm install squine
```

## Usage

```js
import { squine } from 'squine';

// x: Input phase (e.g., between 0 and 1).
// r: Roundness factor (0 = square wave, 1 = sine wave). Default is 0.
const value = squine(0.25, 0.5);
console.log(value);
```

## API

### `squine(x, r = 0)`

- `x` {number}: Input value representing the wave phase.
- `r` {number} [optional]: Roundness factor. 0 = square approximation, 1 = sine approximation, 0.5 = something in between.

Returns `{number}` in the range `[0, 1]`.

## Purpose

I originally wrote this for a game. I used it to give moving platforms a "sweep and loiter" effect in my 2d platformer engine. I've since found other uses for it in things like day/night cycles and generic motion tweening, so I split it into its own lib.
